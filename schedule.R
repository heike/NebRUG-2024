# 1) what is the first Monday of the semester?
# Any number of ways to identify dates in R, but we'll use {lubridate} and the ymd() function here.
# Format: YYYYMMDD. In this example, 4 January 2022.

# Weekday(s) of class

not_here_dates <- c()

# You can adjust this as you see fit. Basically: add assignment types (e.g. papers, quizzes).
# My intro class was fairly simple: just exams.

# In this case: 6 January to 23 April

# Custom function for treating the first day of the month as the first week
# of the month up until the first Sunday (unless Sunday was the start of the month)
wom <- function(date) {
  first <- wday(as.Date(paste(year(date),month(date),1,sep="-")))

# Create a category variable, for filling.
# I can probably make this a case_when(), but this will work.
